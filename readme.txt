Create a simple jQuery Org Chart which will display your team or organisation structure in a hierarchical fashion, using easy drag and drop facilities.

== Description ==


This plugin allows you to seamlessly setup a hierarchical based organisation chart, otherwise known as an Org Chart, for use in your website. We have integrated drag and drop features to ensure the process is intuitive and fast.

The Chart is able to display a Gravatar image and user's display name. In the future we are aiming to add a template system which will allow more information to be displayed.

Now <strong>chart JSON</strong> can be accessed using endpoint.
<blockquote>
Endpoint for JSON. {domain.com}/wp-json/org_chart/json
</blockquote>

JSON format can be updated using "parseJSON" function in index.php . Its a pluggable function.
